# Why ZSH? 
I got a prompt to update from bash in my terminal!!

... 

Only slightly kidding. I *also* use it for.... *oh-my-zsh*! (Yes, yes. Bloat this, bloat that. I hear you!)

Zsh, from what I gather, is just.. more modern than bash. Please no pitchforks if I'm wrong, I'm just the messenger!

<!-- Anyways, I've included my .zshrc.  -->

## Requirements
- oh-my-zsh installed.
- powerlevel10k installed.
- check out my dotfile

etc
