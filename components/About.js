        <div className="content">
          <p>Howdy, I'm Jared! I'm a 4th-year computer science student here at CU Boulder, in Colorado. During my time here, I've discovered and fell in love with programming, as it is a source of never-ending challenge and opportunities for growth, learning, and excitement! I've had the opportunity to serve both as a Course and Teaching assistant, and work with a team of students on a full-stack social media web application.</p>

          <br />

          <p>In my free time, I love learning about web development, reading classic novels, and recreating outdoors. I'm also a sucker for mindfulness meditation, a practice which I find improves all aspects of my life.</p>
